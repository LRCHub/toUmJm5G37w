Hey yo joe, volcano
Hey baby, betray me
Hey baby, you don't know
I'm no joke, we both do
(I'm wanna, I coulda, I shoulda,
I'll never be
I'm gonna, I wanna, I coulda,
You'll always be)
Walking down this? stinking place?
I bet you're mad at me
Eye on the enemy
Right beside me
(So long, so long)
What good is happening?
(Move in, move on)
It seems to empty
I can not be so wrong
With any elegance
So I think I'd rather fix
My own incompetence

I'm on a rampage
I'm out of my cage!

I cannot contain the plane
Of your enlightment
All of these prophets here
Are full of? vicodin?
(So long so long)
To all these skeletons
(?)
?
I cannot see the light
That is in front of me
Worship on the tomahawk
You are my destiny
(So long so long)
I'm on a rampage!
(Move in, move on)
This is the way I breathe

I can not escape the? fate?
Why did you murder me?
My eye on the enemy
Right beside me
What good is happening?
It seems so empty...
