When you walk up to a juke box and you slip a nickel in,
You bet your bottom dollar when that record starts to spin
You'll hear a fiddle and a gittar with a honky tonkin' sound
It's hillbilly fever and it's speadin' all around.

Hillbilly fever's goin' 'round
Good ol' mountain music's got me down.
It's got me robbin' castles, throwin' rice and slippin' around.
Hillbilly fever's got me down.

When you git that jumpy feelin' and you don't know what is wrong
Don't you worry about bother there's a brand new mountain song
That's got the whole durn country rockin' with that big gavel beat
It's the hillbilly breakdown that shakes you off a your feet.

Hillbilly fever's goin' 'round
Good ol' mountain music's got me down.
I spent a Sunday down in Tennessee and here's what I found
Hillbilly fever's goin' 'round.

When that love bug comes around you and you don't know you been stung
And you go and see a doctor and he says poke out your tongue
And he looks into that canyon, tells you brother I got news
You're the victim of sweet buddy and you got the love sick blues.

Hillbilly fever's goin' 'round
Good ol' mountain music's got me down.
I'm gonna one foot, two foot sweet foot drag then I hold you down
Hillbilly fever's goin' 'round...
